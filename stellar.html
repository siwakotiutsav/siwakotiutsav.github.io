          <h3>Lunar Eclipse Over Lawrence, Kansas</h3>

          </div>
          <p>Yesterday was a truly magical evening here in Lawrence, Kansas, as the Moon slipped into Earth’s shadow and put on a captivating celestial show. I’m excited to share my experience photographing the lunar eclipse and present a composite image I created to highlight each phase of this astronomical event.</p>
          <p><strong>The Anticipation</strong><br />
          Lunar eclipses have always fascinated me—there’s something humbling about witnessing our planet’s shadow creeping across the face of the Moon. I began preparing well in advance: checking weather forecasts, scouting a suitable location with minimal light pollution, and planning my camera settings. Thankfully, Lawrence’s clear skies last night provided the perfect backdrop for the eclipse.</p>
          <p><strong>Gear and Setup</strong><br />
          I used my Canon EOS 250D (crop sensor) paired with a 55–250mm lens set to 250mm for all of the shots. A sturdy tripod was essential to keep everything steady—especially important for capturing detailed images of the Moon’s surface. I experimented with various exposure settings and ISO values, adjusting them as the Moon’s brightness changed throughout the eclipse. Each phase required slight tweaks to capture the subtle differences in color and light.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Canon EOS 250D (crop sensor)</li>
            <li><strong>Lens:</strong> 55–250mm at 250mm</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Sturdy tripod</li>
            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Adjusted shutter speed and ISO for each phase</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Processing:</strong> Adobe Photoshop for composite and color balance</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Creating the Composite</strong><br />
          After the eclipse, I gathered all my shots and selected the best image from each phase. I used Adobe Photoshop to arrange them into a single composite, adjusting the size and brightness to highlight each stage in a visually cohesive manner. This technique offers a storytelling perspective: you can see the progression from a bright full Moon to the dramatic red and back again—all in one frame.</p>
          <p><strong>Reflecting on the Experience</strong><br />
          For me, the most rewarding part of photographing a lunar eclipse is the sense of connection to something larger than ourselves. Standing under the night sky in Lawrence, Kansas, I felt a profound appreciation for the elegance of our cosmic neighborhood. Every eclipse reminds me that these celestial events are happening all around us—if we just take the time to look up.</p>

          <h3>Capturing the Hubble Space Telescope Over Kathmandu</h3>
	  <p><em>Published: January 1, 2024</em></p>

          <div class="image fit">
            <img src="astrophotography/hst-nepal.jpg" alt="Hubble Space Telescope trail over Nepal" />
          </div>
          <p>As I was browsing Facebook during the lockdown, I came across a post by the Nepal Astronomical Society (NASO) about tracking the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) online. Intrigued, I set up my Canon EOS 250D with an 18–55mm lens on a tripod and used my phone to follow the HST’s trajectory.</p>
          <p>We waited patiently, but the city lights of Kathmandu made spotting the HST challenging. Just as we were about to give up, a bright dot appeared in the western sky—it was the HST! I quickly aimed the camera and captured its trail.</p>
          <p>I had set ISO 400, 18mm focal length, aperture f/4.0, and a 15-second exposure. Though I only had one chance, the result was a beautiful trail against the night sky. I later enhanced the image in Photoshop to make the HST more visible.</p>
          <p>I hope this shot inspires you to look up and track satellites—you never know what you might capture!</p>

          <h3>Venus and the Pleiades Celestial Dance</h3>
          <p><em>Published: April 2, 2021</em></p>

          <div class="image fit">
            <img src="astrophotography/venus-pleiades.jpg" alt="Venus and the Pleiades alignment" />
          </div>
          <p>On the night of April 3, 2020, Venus and the Pleiades aligned in a stunning celestial dance visible only once every eight years. Using my EOS 250D and a 55–250mm lens at f/5.6, ISO 1600, I captured a series of images.</p>
          <p>Though my crop sensor limited me, I stacked five JPEG frames to achieve an effective 10-second exposure, revealing Venus and the Pleiades cluster sharply against the sky.</p>
          <p>The final image highlights the rare beauty of this event—proof that creative techniques can overcome technical constraints.</p>

          <h3>Orion Unbound: Capturing the Hunter in Bhaktapur</h3>
          
	  <p><em>Published: October 28, 2020</em></p>
          <div class="image fit">

          </div>
          <p>Orion, the celestial hunter, has long been a winter sky icon. During a visit to Bhaktapur Durbar Square, I challenged myself to photograph it despite city light pollution and no star tracker.</p>
          <p>Armed with my EOS 250D, 55–250mm lens, and tripod, I experimented with exposure times slightly beyond the 500 rule. By stacking multiple shots, I captured Orion’s belt amidst urban lights, creating a unique image that blends cityscape and cosmos.</p>
          <p>This shot celebrates perseverance and reminds us that the universe’s wonders are accessible anywhere.</p>
