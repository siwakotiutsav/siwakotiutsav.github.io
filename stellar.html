    </div>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> astronomy, astrophotography, Canon EOS 250D, lunar eclipse, total eclipse, March 14, 2025</p>

    <h3><strong>Chasing Earth’s Shadow</strong></h3>
    <p>Yesterday was a truly magical evening here in Lawrence, Kansas, as the Moon slipped into Earth’s shadow and put on a captivating celestial show. I’m excited to share my experience photographing the lunar eclipse and present a composite image I created to highlight each phase of this astronomical event.</p>

    <h3><strong>The Anticipation</strong></h3>
    <p>Lunar eclipses have always fascinated me—there’s something humbling about witnessing our planet’s shadow creeping across the face of the Moon. I began preparing well in advance: checking weather forecasts, scouting a suitable location with minimal light pollution, and planning my camera settings. Thankfully, Lawrence’s clear skies last night provided the perfect backdrop for the eclipse.</p>

    <h3><strong>Gear and Setup</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Camera: Canon EOS 250D (crop sensor)</li>
      <li>Lens: 55–250mm at 250mm</li>
      <li>Support: Sturdy tripod</li>
      <li>Settings: Adjusted shutter speed and ISO for each phase</li>
      <li>Post-Processing: Adobe Photoshop for composite and color balance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Watching the Eclipse Unfold</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Before Eclipse:</strong> The Moon started off bright and fully illuminated. I took a few baseline shots to capture the crisp lunar details, from craters to maria (the darker basaltic plains on the Moon).</p>
    <p><strong>Eclipse Begins:</strong> As the Earth’s shadow began to nibble at the Moon’s edge, it felt like watching the first act of a cosmic ballet. The contrast between the bright illuminated portion and the emerging shadow was striking.</p>
    <p><strong>50% Partial:</strong> This was the moment when the Moon looked especially dramatic—half shrouded in darkness, half gleaming in white. The surface details on the lit portion provided a beautiful contrast against the reddening shadow.</p>
    <p><strong>Total Eclipse:</strong> Often referred to as the “Blood Moon,” the total eclipse stage saw the Moon take on a deep coppery-red hue. This occurs because sunlight filtering through Earth’s atmosphere scatters the shorter blue wavelengths, leaving predominantly red light to reach the Moon’s surface.</p>
    <p><strong>Greatest Eclipse:</strong> At the peak, the red tone was at its most vivid. Photographing this phase can be tricky because the Moon is dimmer than usual—raising the ISO and slowing the shutter speed was crucial to capturing enough detail.</p>

    <h3><strong>Creating the Composite</strong></h3>
    <p>After the eclipse, I gathered all my shots and selected the best image from each phase. I used Adobe Photoshop to arrange them into a single composite, adjusting the size and brightness to highlight each stage in a visually cohesive manner. This technique offers a storytelling perspective: you can see the progression from a bright full Moon to the dramatic red and back again—all in one frame.</p>

    <h3><strong>Reflecting on the Experience</strong></h3>
    <p>For me, the most rewarding part of photographing a lunar eclipse is the sense of connection to something larger than ourselves. Standing under the night sky in Lawrence, Kansas, I felt a profound appreciation for the elegance of our cosmic neighborhood. Every eclipse reminds me that these celestial events are happening all around us—if we just take the time to look up.</p>

    <p>I hope this composite image and my account of the evening convey some of that wonder. Whether you’re a seasoned astronomer or just someone who loves a good sky show, witnessing a lunar eclipse is an unforgettable experience. If you missed this one, keep an eye on upcoming eclipse dates—there’s always another cosmic spectacle on the horizon!</p>

      <h2>How I Captured the Hubble Space Telescope</h2>
      <p>Published: December 31, 2023</p>
    </summary>
    <div class="image fit">
      <img src="astrophotography/hubble.jpg" alt="Long exposure photo of Hubble Space Telescope trail across night sky" style="width: 1280px; height: 720px;"/>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> astrophotography, Hubble Space Telescope, Kathmandu, Canon EOS 250D, satellite tracking, long exposure, NASO</p>

    <h3><strong>How I Captured the Hubble Space Telescope</strong></h3>
    <p>As I was browsing Facebook during the lockdown, I came across a post by the Nepal Astronomical Society (NASO) that caught my eye. It was about the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) passing over Nepal and how to track it online. I was intrigued by the idea of seeing this amazing piece of technology that has been orbiting the Earth for over three decades and has given us stunning images of the universe.</p>

    <p>I decided to give it a try and set up my Canon EOS 250D with an 18–55mm STM lens on a tripod. I also used my phone to follow the HST’s trajectory on the NASO website. I called my brother Nurap Karki to join me in this adventure and explained to him how to spot the HST in the sky.</p>

    <p>We waited patiently for the right moment, but we were getting frustrated as the time was running out and we couldn’t see anything in the western direction. The light pollution from the city of Kathmandu was making it hard to see the stars. But then, just as we were about to give up, we saw a bright dot moving fast across the sky. It was the HST!</p>

    <p>I quickly grabbed the tripod and aimed the camera at the moving dot. I hoped that the camera settings were good enough to capture it. I had set the ISO to 400, the focal length to 18mm, the aperture to f/4.0, and the exposure time to 15 seconds. I pressed the shutter button and prayed that the focus was right. I knew I had only one chance to get this shot.</p>

    <p>To my delight, the camera did its job and captured the HST’s trail in the night sky. It was not a perfect shot, but it was a beautiful one. I wished I had more time to adjust the settings and the focus, but I was happy with what I got. It was a close call, but we made it. It was a wonderful experience and I am glad to share it with you. I have attached the image that I edited with Adobe Photoshop to make the HST more visible.</p>

    <p>I hope you enjoyed this story and learned something new. If you want to see more of my photos and stories, please follow my blog. Thank you.</p>

    <h3><strong>Venus and the Pleiades Celestial Dance</strong></h3>
    <p>On the enchanting night of April 3rd, 2020, a celestial spectacle unfolded as Venus and the Pleiades aligned in a rare cosmic dance. Such a captivating alignment occurs only once every eight years, making it a truly remarkable opportunity for photography enthusiasts.</p>

    <p>Without hesitation, I swiftly grabbed my EOS 250D paired with a 55–250mm f/4–5.6 lens and set up my tripod on the terrace. With a manual focus on the frame, I eagerly captured the moment. The featured image was taken at 250mm with an aperture of f/5.6, exposing for just 2 seconds. To enhance the shot, I set the ISO to 1600 and snapped a series of continuous shots, ensuring the Pleiades remained in sharp focus throughout.</p>

    <p>Given the constraints of my crop sensor reaching around 400mm, the 500 rule suggested a mere 1.25 seconds of exposure. However, I aimed for a longer exposure time to capture the scene as desired. Unlike many astrophotographers who opt for a full-frame sensor and a star tracker for extended exposure, I creatively utilized the resources at my disposal. By stacking 5 JPEG images, I achieved a total exposure time of approximately 10 seconds, revealing a clearer view of Venus against the stellar backdrop.</p>

    <p>In retrospect, it was a truly magical moment to capture this celestial alignment. Stay tuned for more astronomical wonders, and feel free to share your thoughts on this mesmerizing shot in the comments below.</p>

    <h3><strong>Orion Unbound: Capturing the Mighty Hunter from Bhaktapur Durbar Square</strong></h3>
    <p>Orion, the celestial hunter, has captivated humanity for millennia. Its distinct silhouette, etched across the winter sky, has inspired countless myths and legends. But what about capturing its grandeur from a bustling city square, amidst the din of daily life and the unrelenting grip of light pollution?</p>

    <p>That's the challenge I recently embraced, armed with my trusty camera and a determined spirit. Standing in the heart of Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Kathmandu's vibrant cultural gem, I aimed my lens skyward, eager to snag a glimpse of the mighty hunter amidst the urban sprawl.</p>

    <p>Let's be honest, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, for all its charm, isn't exactly prime real estate for astrophotography. The warm glow of streetlights, the rhythmic hum of traffic, and the sheer vibrancy of the city life, all conspire to shroud the celestial tapestry in a veil of man-made illumination.</p>

    <p>My equipment, too, wasn't exactly top-of-the-line. No fancy wide-aperture lenses or high-tech trackers in my arsenal. Just a trusty camera and a tripod, paired with a healthy dose of astro-enthusiasm and a thirst for the extraordinary.</p>

    <p>But as the saying goes, where there's a will, there's a way. And so, I began my celestial dance, waltzing with the limitations, my shutter clicks echoing in the stillness of the square. I adjusted exposures, tweaked settings, and experimented with angles, all the while battling the stubborn glow that threatened to wash out the celestial canvas.</p>

    <p>Then, it happened. As if in response to my unwavering pursuit, the heavens yielded a fleeting glimpse of their magic. The familiar outline of Orion emerged from the urban haze, its three-starred belt gleaming defiantly against the encroaching light.</p>

    <p>In that brief moment, the bustling square around me faded away. The traffic hummed into a distant lullaby, and the city lights turned into twinkling companions, cheering on my celestial quest. It was a testament to the resilience of the cosmos, a beacon of hope amidst the concrete jungle, whispering tales of celestial wonders beyond the city's grasp.</p>

    <p>Sure, this capture wasn't the epitome of astrophotographic perfection. It lacked the razor-sharp clarity of shots snagged under pristine skies, the kind that graces astronomy textbooks and National Geographic spreads. But in its imperfections lay a unique beauty, a story of perseverance and the thrill of wresting a celestial gem from the clutches of urban light.</p>

    <p>This Bhaktapur Orion, captured with limited means and boundless spirit, serves as a reminder that the wonders of the universe are accessible to all, even amidst the most unlikely settings. It's a call to embrace the limitations, to dance with the constraints, and to seek the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>

    <p>So, the next time you find yourself gazing up at the city sky, remember—even the faintest glimmer of a celestial wonder can be a testament to the boundless beauty of the universe, waiting to be discovered, one starry click at a time.</p>

    <p>And who knows, maybe someday, armed with a wider aperture and a faster lens, I'll return to Bhaktapur Durbar Square, ready to capture Orion in all its unbridled glory. But for now, this imperfectly perfect click—a testament to the tenacity of the human spirit and the enduring allure of the cosmos—will forever hold a special place in my celestial vault.</p>
